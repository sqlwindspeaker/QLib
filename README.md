# QLib

QLib is aimed to help fullstack developers to have a unified interface while developing projects with 2 or more languages involved. With the help of QLib, fullstack developers will no longer be aware of the different method names and argument orders for the "same" function in different languages such as *array_slice(arr, start, length)* in **PHP** and *Array.prototype.slice(start, end)* in **Javascript**.

**Note**: This library will involve 1 more function call normally. So use it carefully in performace-sensitive places.
